# Jupyter notebooks
Different notebooks from projects.


## Outline:
- [Ensemble_PROJECTS.ipynb](https://github.com/andrey-09/notebooks/blob/55eb2a6fb2307af322e946fdf95de6a541e20c92/Ensemble_PROJECTS.ipynb) (notebook of different ensemble methods (bagging, pasting, boosting and stacking) on the Moon dataset + Mnist Dataset. As Predictors I used models such as Decision Trees (building RandomForests + ExtraForest), Support Vector Machines (LinearSVC) 

- [Dimensionality_reduction_PROJECTS.ipynb](https://github.com/andrey-09/notebooks/blob/9fa26199eb196503d9b051952e892f1eca59fd16/Dimensionality_reduction_PROJECTS.ipynb) (notebook with different dimensionality reduction algorithms on the mnist data set and on the 3d to 2d transformation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), LLE and MDS. Test on building a Pipeline with a reduction and then using a RandomForestClassifier. Combining multiple reductin algorithms (PCA+t-SNE)
